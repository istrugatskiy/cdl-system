CDL Plant Project
A tool for managing your plant-waterer.
Developed for collaborative design lab class in high school.
Uses the bluetooth API to communicate with device "securely".
Although the web interface functions well, the project is limited
by the fact that the Arduino model provided by our high school could not concurrently run Bluetooth and Wifi.
The codebase was limited to 48kb, which was not enough to load both the Bluetooth and Wifi libraries.
This project was my first real experience working with limited technical resources on embedded devices.
Some comments in the Arduino code are designed for students from other teams who borrowed the software platform.
This project has notification support because it was a project requirement.
